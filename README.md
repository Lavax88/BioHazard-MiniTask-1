# 📅 CSE(B) S1 Weekly Timetable

This repository contains my submission for **Biohazard Minitask 1**. The task was to design a **weekly timetable** using **HTML** and apply proper styling for readability and clarity.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The timetable displays the weekly schedule for **CSE(B) Semester 1**. It makes use of:

* **HTML tables** for layout.
* **Rowspan and Colspan** to merge cells where classes extend across time slots.
* **Custom background colors** for each subject to visually differentiate them.
* A clean and minimal **Segoe UI font family** for modern readability.
